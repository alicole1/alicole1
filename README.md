Hello! My name is Ali Cole (she/her) :D
- 📓 As of right now, I'm a junior in high school
- 👩🏻‍💻 I have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, and C# and use them quite often, but I haven't created a committed GitHub account to store everything until now :o
- 🦾 I'm interested in all kinds of engineering, working on web development, game design, and Arduino programming
- 👋🏻 If you'd like to reach out, you can find me at cole24793@gmail.com
- 🪴 Fun fact about me... I'm a big fan of puns, plants, and long math equations :>
